"""
This module provides a module-wide exit callback registry that allows you to register
exit callbacks from any thread. Every registered callback is stored as a weak reference,
so that if the owning object is garbage collected the callback will not be invoked.

Callbacks are registered via the function:
    register_exit_callback(callback, priority=1)

Callbacks are expected to have the signature:
    callback(signum, frame)
where signum and frame are provided if the exit is triggered via a signal, or may be None
if the exit is normal.

The global exit handler is automatically registered in the main thread for SIGINT (Ctrl-C),
and SIGTERM (termination signal), and SIGHUP (PyCharm Stop). Also, it is registered via
the atexit module to trigger upon normal interpreter shutdown. When the exit handler fires,
it sorts callbacks in descending order (highest priority first) and calls each one safely.
